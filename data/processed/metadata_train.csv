[No national unity in Germany.]

The establishment of German unity in our own day after a victorious struggle with France renders
it difficult to imagine the voluntary submission of a great part of the race to a French sovereign,
or to excuse a policy which, like that of 1806, appears the opposite of everything honourable
and patriotic. But what seems strange now was not strange then. No expression more truly describes
the conditions of that period than one of the great German poet who"," done his work long enough in
villages to know the village mind and the scale of proportions by which its gladness and sadness
were measured. He knew more of all this than Mount Dunstan could, since Mount Dunstan's existence
had isolated itself, from rather gloomy choice. But as he rode, Mount Dunstan knew that he

“No man knoweth the day nor the hour,” was the argument most often brought forward by rejecters
